# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
name = ["alekh","taksh","rahil","krunal","harsh","rudra"]
print(f"{name[0]} is a good boy")
print(f"{name[1]} is a good boy")
print(f"{name[2]} is a good boy")
print(f"{name[3]} is a good boy")
print(f"{name[4]} is a good boy")
print(f"{name[5]} is a good boy")
